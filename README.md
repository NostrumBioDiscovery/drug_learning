# drug_learning
Open package with DL and ML tools for drug discovery. It is based in a 3 branch package: 2D-QSAR, 3D-QSAR, simulation+AI

## To developers

master: This should always be working and ready for production!

devel: Only for pre-releases. This should be the test branch before merging to master. **All custom function should have their own unit-test here!**

2D: 2D Deep learning methodologies

3D: 3D Deep learning methodologies

simulation: Couple simulation analysis with optimization based algorithms (ML).
